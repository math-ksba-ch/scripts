Look at the following four problems. You don't have to solve these problems yet, just formalize them, i.e. find the 
equations which describe the situation. 


\begin{exer}\label{exer1}
Two types of coffee: the first one costs 18 Swiss francs per kilo, the second 25 Swiss francs per kilo. We have to produce a mixture of 5 kilos. How much coffee of each type must be selected for the mixture to cost 20 Swiss francs per kilo?

\subsection{System of Linear Equations}

In the above examples, one equation was not enough to describe the situation. We needed two or even three. This is called a \textbf{system} of equations. 
\vsp


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]
\begin{definition}
A \textbf{$m\times n$-system of equations} is a set of $m$ equations which all contain the same $n$ variables. The system is called \textbf{linear (SLE)} if all equations are linear. 
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vsp

Before we start to solve such a system of linear equations, we standardize the way that we write down these systems to make them easier to be solved:
\vsp

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]
We denote the SLE in the so-called \textbf{normal form}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item On the left-hand side of the equation sign are all terms with variables, denoted in an alphabetical order. 
\item On the right-hand side of the equation sign are all terms with only numbers. 
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vsp

\begin{example}
\[
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{any form}\\
\\
2x+3y-8=0 \\
x+3=2y 
\end{array}
\hsp\Rightarrow\hsp
\begin{array}{ll}
\text{normal form}\\
\\
2x+3y=8 \\
x-2y=-3 
\end{array}
\]
\end{example}
\vsp

\subsection{The Solution of a System of Linear Equations}
What does it mean to solve a system of linear equations? 
\vsp

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]\begin{definition}
A solution of a system of linear equations with $n$ variables is given by an ordered tuple of $n$ values: If we insert these $n$ values into the variables, all equations will be correct simultaneously (i.e. all of them denote a correct statement).
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vsp

\begin{example}
Let's have a look at the following system of linear equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(I)] $x+2y=7$
\item[(II)] $2x-y=-1$
\end{itemize}
If we insert $1$ for $x$ and $3$ for $y$, the two equations denote a correct statement:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(I)] $1+2\cdot 3=7$
\item[(II)] $2\cdot 1-3=-1$
\end{itemize}
Therefore, $(1/3)$ is a solution of the system of linear equations.Actually, it is the only correct solution (which we cannot yet prove)which means that
\[
\mathbb{L}=\{(1/3)\}.
\]
\end{example}
\vsp

\begin{example}
Let's consider the following system of linear equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(I)] $x+y+2z=4$
\item[(II)] $-x+3y+4z=1$
\item[(III)] $2x+y=3$.
\end{itemize}
If we insert $2$ for $x$, $-1$ for $y$ and $1.5$ for $z$, we get correct statements for all three equations:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(I)] $2+(-1)+2\cdot 1.5=4$
\item[(II)] $-2+3\cdot (-1)+4\cdot 1.5=1$
\item[(III)] $2\cdot 2+(-1)=3$
\end{itemize}
Therefore, $(2/-1/1.5)$ is a solution of this system of linear equations. Again, it is the only solution (which we still can't prove yet) and therefore
\[
\mathbb{L}=\{(2/-1/1.5)\}.
\]
\end{example}

\subsection{How to Solve a SLE}

To solve a SLE we need to find values for all variables such that all equations are solved simultaneously. But how can we find such a solution of the system of linear equations without guessing or simple trial and error?? There are two methods we will look at: the substitution method and the elimination method. But before we look at these methods, you should think about the problem yourself: How could you solve the following two systems of linear equations:


\begin{exer}\label{exer:SLE}

% [[file:../index.org::*The Substitution Method][The Substitution Method:1]]
\subsubsection{The Substitution Method}

The name of this method gives us a hint of what's going on: ``substituere'' means ``replacing'', ``inserting''.  
\vsp

\begin{example}
To solve the $2\times 2$-system of the above exercise \ref{exer:SLE}, we solve the first equation for $y$
\[
(I) \hsp 3x-y=-1 \hsp \Leftrightarrow \hsp 3x=y-1 \hsp\Leftrightarrow \hsp y=3x+1
\]
and use this result by replacing the $y$ in the second equation by the result we just got:
\[
(II) \hsp  -6x+7\cdot (3x+1) =12
\]
We got a linear equation in one variable which is easy to solve:
\[
(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp -6x+21x+7=12 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 15x=5 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp x=\frac13
\]
Again, we use the result for $y$ we got from the first equation (I) which gives 
\[
y=3x+1=3\cdot \frac 13+1 = 2
\]
Therefore, the solution is given by $x=\frac{1}{3}$ and $y=2$, i.e. by the 2-tuple $(\frac13/ 2)$.
\end{example}
\vsp\vsp

\begin{example}
To solve the $3\times 3$-system of the above exercise \ref{exer:SLE}, we solve one of the equations for one variable, for example $z$, and use this result by entering it into the two other equations to get a $2\times 2$-system:
\[
(I)\hsp x+y+z=2 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp z=2-x-y
\]
Replace $z$ in the two other equations:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(II) &2x-y+(2-x-y)&=&-1\\
(III)  &-x+2y-3\cdot(2-x-y)&=&6
\end{array}
\]
Simplifying the equations a bit, we get
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(II)&x-2y &=&-3 \\
(III)&2x+5y&=&12
\end{array}
\]
We get a $2\times 2$-system. Apply the same procedure again to this new system: Solve equation (II) for $x$: 
\[
x=2y-3 \hspace{3cm} (*)
\]
Replacing $x$ by this solution in equation (III) gives
\[
2(2y-3)+5y=12 \hsp\Rightarrow\hsp 4y-6+5y=12 \hsp\Rightarrow\hsp 9y=18 \hsp\Rightarrow\hsp y=2.
\]
Insert this result into equation (*) to get the solution for $x$:
\[
x=2\cdot 2-3=1
\]
Now insert these results into equation (I) to get
\[
z=2-1-2=-1.
\]
The solution of the system of linear equations is therefore $(1/2/-1)$. Notice that the order of the numbers is important. The value of $x$ always comes first, then the value of $y$ and then the one of $z$. 
\end{example}

\vsp\vsp

Now it should be clear how to solve an arbitrary $n\times n$-system:


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]

\textbf{The Substitution Method}:

\begin{itemize}
\item	Solve one of the equations (for examples the first one) with respect to one variable:
\[(I) \hsp \Leftrightarrow \hsp x=\framebox[1.1\width][l]{\text{term without x}}\]
\item	Replace (substitute) in all other equations the $x$'s by that term you got. Simplify these equations.
\item We get a $(n-1)\times(n-1)$-system. Repeat the steps above till you get a linear equation in just one variable and solve this equation.
\item Enter the solution in reverse order into the solutions you got for the variables to get all values of the variables and therefore a solution of the system. 
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\vsp

\begin{remark}
You need to be a bit careful when applying the substitution method:

Assume that $3(x-1)+y=x+5$ is an equation of a SLE. Solving this equation for $y$, we get $y=8-2x$. Now we should replace $y$ in all the other equations by that term. But what happens if we enter this term by accident into this equation itself?

\[
3(x-1)+(8-2x)=x+5 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 3x-3+8-2x=x+5 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp x+5=x+5
\]

Of course, we get a correct statement, but not one which is very helpful. This equation is true for every value of $x$. The information of the equation is kind of lost. Therefore: Never use the same equation again after solving one equation for a variable. This equation has been exhausted and should not be used again. 
\end{remark}

% [[file:../index.org::*The Elimination Method][The Elimination Method:1]]
\subsubsection{The Elimination Method}
The main goal when solving a system of linear equations is to get rid of variables. This can be done by substitution. But often there are easier ways to do so. The elimination method adds equations together to get new equations with fewer variables. 

\begin{example}
Let's have a look at the following $2\times 2$-system:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I) &3x-y &=&-1\\
(II) &-6x+7y&=&12\\
\end{array}
\]

We transform the first equation a little bit by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)'&6x- 2y &=&-2\\
(II)&-6x+7y&=&12\\
\end{array}
\]
 
If we add the two equations together (i.e. the left and the right-hand sides of the equations) we get a new equations which is correct as long as (I) and (II) are correct. But this new equation is much easier than the original ones, since it contains only one variable:

\[
2\cdot (I)+(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp (I)'+(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 5y=10
\]

Therefore, $y=2$.

Entering this solution for $y$ into either (I) or (II) we get $x=\frac{1}{3}, y=2$.
\end{example}
\vsp


\begin{example} 
Let us consider a $3\times 3$-system. We have to do the procedure twice to get two equations in two variables:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&x+y+z&=&2\\
(II)&2x-y+z&=&-1\\
(III)&-x+2y-3z&=&6
\end{array}
\]
 
Adding (I) and (III) gives an equation without $x$. 
\[
(I)+(III) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 3y-2z=8
\]

By multiplying (I) by $-2$ and adding this new equation and (II) together, we get:
\[
(-2)\cdot (I)+(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp -3y-z=-5
\]

Now, the system has ``one dimension less''. We got two new equations in just two variables:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)'&3y-2z&=&8\\
(II)'&-3y-z&=&-5\\
\end{array}
\]	 

Adding these two equations together, we get
\[
(I)'+(II)' \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp -3z=3
\]
and therefore $z=-1$. Now we use this solution to get the solutions for $x$ and $y$:
\[
\begin{array}{l}
(I)' \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 3y-2\cdot (-1)=8 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp y=2\\
(I)  \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp x+2+(-1)=2 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp x=1\\
\end{array}
\]
Of course, we could have used $(II)'$ and $(II)$ or $(III)$ as well instead of $(I)'$ and $(I)$. The solution of the SLE is $(1/2/-1)$.
\end{example}


\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]
\textbf{The Elimination Method}:

An arbitrary $n\times n$-system may be solved by
\begin{itemize}
\item multiplying (I) and (II) by appropriate numbers and adding them to eliminate a variable, for example $x$,
\item multiplying (I) and (III) by appropriate numbers and adding them to eliminate the same variable,
\item multiplying (I) and (IV) by appropriate numbers and adding them to eliminate the same variable,
\item $\ldots$
\item multiplying (I) and (n) by appropriate numbers and adding them to eliminate the same variable,
\end{itemize}

We get a $(n-1)\times(n-1)$-system which does not include one variable (in our case $x$) anymore. 

Repeat the whole procedure till you get a $1\times 1$-system. 

Insert the solution you get for the last variable into one of the equations of the $2\times 2$-system to get the solution of the second last variable. Insert these two solutions in one of the equations of the $3\times 3$-system to get the solution of the third last variable and so on till you get the solutions of all variables.
\end{tcolorbox}
\vsp

\begin{remark}
Of course, there are always several ways in which to solve such a system. You can also mix the substitution and elimination method. Often there are shortcuats and if you see them, you can solve the system much quicker than by just applying the same method all the time. 

Mathematicians always try to find neat ways how to solve riddles, so feel free to be creative: Have a close look at the system before solving it and try to find the shortest way how to solve it. By the way, solving it like that makes much more fun!

\subsection{Graphical Solution}

Let's have a look at the following $2\times 2$-SLE:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&x-1&=&y+1\\
(II)&x+1&=&2(y-1)\\
\end{array}
\]	

We can first solve both equation with respect to $y$:
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&y&=&x-2\\
(II)&y&=&\frac{x+3}{2}\\
\end{array}
\]	

Each of these equations can be interpreted as lines in the 2-dimensional coordinate system:


\begin{figure}[h]

{\includegraphics[height=7cm]{ZweiGeraden}}

\end{figure}

\begin{remark}
You probably remember from the Bezirkschule that for $y=ax+b$, $a$ denotes the gradient of the line and $b$ denotes the $y$-axes-interception.
\end{remark}

The two lines denote the set of all 2-tuples $(x/y)$ which fulfil the two equations (I) and (II). The intersection point of the two lines stands for the only point which fulfils both equations and is therefore the solution of the system of linear equations. 
\vsp

We can see in the above sketch that $(7/5)$ is the intersection point of the two lines and therefore $x=7, y=5$ is the solution of the above system of linear equations.

\subsubsection{Linearly Dependent SLE}

We learnt two methods how to solve a SLE. Nevertheless, things can go wrong sometimes:

\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&3x&=&2y+3\\
(II)&x-\frac{2}{3}y&=&1\\
\end{array}
\]

At first glance everything is fine with this system of linear equations. But:

\[
(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 3x-2y=3 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 3x=2y+3 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp (I)
\]

The two equations are actually equivalent, i.e. we may multiply one equation by a number to get exactly the other one. We get a $1\times 2$-system. This system has infinitely many solutions: $\left(0/-\frac{3}{2}\right)$, $(1/0)$ or $(3/3)$ are all solutions of the system and there are many more.
\vsp

From the graphical point of view this just means that we have twice the same line and therefore there are infinitely many intersection points.
\vsp

We can solve the one equation with respect to $x$ to get
\[
x=1+\frac{2}{3}y.
\]
We get the solution set
\[
\left\{(x/y) \in \R^2 \mid x=1+\frac{2}{3}y\right\} \hsp\hsp\text{ or } \hsp\hsp (1+\frac{2}{3}\lambda / \lambda) \text{ for all } \lambda \in \R.
\]

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]\begin{definition}
If we are able to transform an equation by linear operations into another one, we call the two equations \textbf{linearly dependent}. If a system of linear equations contains linearly dependent equations we call the SLE \textbf{linearly dependent}, too.
\end{definition}
\end{tcolorbox}
\vsp

\begin{example}

\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&x+y+z&=&5\\
(II)&x+2y-3z&=&10\\
(III)&2x+3y-2z&=&15\\
\end{array}
\]
Add (I) and (II) we get the equation (III). The SLE is linearly dependent and we can omit the third equation, since the information of the third equation is already contained in the first two equations. The SLE is therefore equivalent to
\[
\begin{array}{lrcl}
(I)&x+y+z&=&5\\
(II)&x+2y-3z&=&10\\
\end{array}
\]
Solving the first equation $(I)$ with respect to $x$ we get $x=5-y-z$ $(I')$. Inserting this solution into $(II)$ gives
\[
5-y-z+2y-3z=10 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp y-4z=5 \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp y=5+4z
\]
Replacing $y$ in $(I)'$ results in
\[
x=5-(5+4z)-z=-5z.
\]
The solution is therefore 
\[
\left(-5\lambda / 5+4\lambda / \lambda \right) \hsp\text{ for } \lambda \in \R
\]
or similarly
\[
\mathbb{L}=\left\{(x/y/z)\in \R^3\mid x=-5z \text{ and } y=5+4z)\right\}.

(I)&2x-y&=&5\\
(II)&2y&=&7+4x\\

\]
Notice that
\[
(II) \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp -7=4x-2y \hsp\Leftrightarrow\hsp 2x-y=-3.5

and therefore we get the equivalent system
\[

The two equations contradict each other! There is no solution. Geometrically this means that the two lines are parallel and therefore there is no intersection point and

\subsection{\tr|The Coefficient Matrix|Die Koeffizientenmatrix|}

\tr|The methods we used so far involve a lot of writing. You might have realized how often you simply copy the variables.
    In addition it is not at all obvious how to write a program that solves a linear system.  
   |Die bisher erarbeiteten Methoden zur Lösung eines LGS bedeuten einen grossen Schreibaufwand.
    Zudem ist nicht offensichtlich, wie sie in ein Rezept (einen Algorithmus) umgewandelt werden können,
    welchem auch eine Maschine (z.B. ein Computer) problemlos folgen kann. |
\tr|
   |
    \begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]\begin{definition} 
    Ein \textbf{Algorithmus} ist ein automatisierbares Verfahren, das in endlich vielen Schritten einen Input zu einem Output verarbeitet. 
    Dabei muss jeder Schritt aus einer eindeutigen Anweisung bestehen, die programmierbar ist. 
    \end{definition}
    \end{tcolorbox}
    Idealerweise mündet ein Algorithmus in ein Computerprogramm, welches das Problem ohne weiteres menschliches Zutun automatisch löst. 
    \vsp
    |
\subsubsection*{\tr|How can we eliminate both problems at once?
  |Wie können wir diese zwei Nachteile (grosser Schreibaufwand und nicht offensichtlicher Algorithmus) beheben?| }

\tr|
   |Die sogenannte Gauss-Elimination liefert ein Algorithmus, der zu einem LGS (als Input) das Lösungstupel berechnet oder aber aufzeigt, dass das System singulär ist.
   In der hier vorgestellten Form geht der Algorithmus zurück auf den berühmten deutschen Mathematiker C. F. Gauss (1777-1855). |
\vsp

\tr|First of all we will minimize notational overhead. 
   |Zunächst minimieren wir den Schreibaufwand, indem wir von einem LGS nur das Allernötigste notieren.|

\begin{example}
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
2x+4y-3z&=&-7\\
x+y+6z&=&1\\
-x+2y+3z&=&-4\\
\end{array}
\]
\end{example}
	 
\tr|From now on we will write all equations in normal form. In addition we fix some order for the variables (e.g. lexikogrgaphical order)
    We also want to get rid of the '+' and '-' signs, hence we have to make sure that there are only '+' signs. If there happens to be a '-' sign we simply
    attach it to the constant factor in front of the following variable (and invent a factor 1 if necessary).
   |Wir schreiben ab jetzt Gleichungen immer zuerst in der \glqq Normalform \grqq,
   wobei wir zusätzlich die Variablen in lexikographischer Reihenfolge schreiben und nur Pluszeichen (keine Minuszeichen, respektive wir nehmen das Minus zur Zahl) verwenden:|
\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
2x+4y+(-3)z&=&-7\\
x+y+6z&=&1\\
(-1)x+2y+3z&=&-4\\
\end{array}
\]
\vsp

\trx;We represent the position of the =  sign with a vertical bar. 
    ;Nun genügt es, die Koeffizienten aufzuschreiben, um das System eindeutig zu repräsentieren:;
\[
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
2&4&-3&-7\\
1&1&6&1\\
-1&2&3&-4
\end{array}\right]
\]

	 
\tr|We can reconstruct the original linear system from this representation, but we got rid of all variables, '=' and  '+' signs. 
   |Aus dieser Darstellung kann das LGS eindeutig rekonstruiert werden, aber wir sparen beim Aufschreiben alle Variablen, Gleichheits- und Operationszeichen ein.|

\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=white]
\begin{definition}
\tr|For a  $m\times n$ linear system in \textbf{normalform} 
   |Ein $m\times n$-LGS liegt in \textbf{Normalform} vor, genau dann wenn es folgende Form hat:|

\[
\begin{array}{rcl}
a_{1,1}x_1+a_{1,2}x_2+\ldots+a_{1,n}x_n&=&b_1\\
a_{2,1}x_1+a_{2,2}x_2+\ldots+a_{2,n}x_n&=&b_2\\
&\cdots&\\
a_{m,1}x_1+a_{m,2}x_2+\ldots+a_{m,n}x_n&=&b_m\\
\end{array}
\] 
\vsp

\trx;we define the \textbf{extended coefficient matrix} to be the following scheme:
    ;Unter der \textbf{erweiterten Koeffizientenmatrix} versteht man die schematische Darstellung aller Koeffizienten und Konstanten in der Form;
\[
\left[\begin{array}{llll|l}
a_{1,1}&a_{1,2}&\cdots&a_{1,n}&b_1\\
a_{2,1}&a_{2,2}&\cdots&a_{2,n}&b_2\\
&&\cdots&&\\
a_{m,1}&a_{m,2}&\cdots&a_{m,n}&b_m\\
\end{array}\right]
\]
\tr|The 'extended' refers to the fact that the matrix also contains the $b$ paramters. Without this last column the matrix is usually called the 'coefficient matrix'.
    We take the liberty to omit the 'extended' if it is clear form the context which matrix we mean.
   |Der Zusatz 'erweitert' bezieht sich auf die Tatsache, dass die Matrix auch die $b$ Paramaterin der letzen Spalte enthält. Ohne diese letzte Spalte nenn man die Matrix
    üblicherweise nur die 'Koeffizienten Matrix'. Wir werden den Zusatz 'erweitert' manchmal weglassen, wenn klar ist, welche Matrix gemeint ist.|

\par\medskip
\tr|So far we have only reduced the notational overhead; but the system is not yet solved.

    or where we can simply read off the solution.

\tr|We can always reduce the coefficient matrix of a non-singular $n\times n$ system to reduced triangular form using only the following operations:

\end{itemize}
\end{theorem}
\end{tcolorbox}



\begin{proof}
\tr|Somewhere in the first column has to be a non-zero entry, otherwise this wouldn't be a $n\times n$ system.
    Using operation 1 we can make sure that the element in the upper left corner is non-zero. 
   |Die erste Spalte besteht nicht nur aus Nullen, da es sich sonst nicht um ein $n\times n$-LGS handelt. Anhand von Operation 1 können wir dafür sorgen, dass oben links eine Zahl ungleich Null steht:|
\begin{eqnarray*}

a\neq 0& \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\

\tr|Using operation 2 we can arrange 1 in the upper left corner.|Anhand von Operation 2 können wir oben links eine 1 erreichen:|

1& \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\tr|Repeated application of operation 2 and 3 produces 0's under this 1.|Mehrmalige Anwendung von Operation 2 und 3 erzeugt unter der 1 Nullen.|
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
1& \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\tr|The first colums now has the desired shape and we won't change it in the next steps.
    From now on we ignore the first columns and the first row and consider the remaining $(n-1) \times n-1$ matrix.
   |Ab jetzt ändern und benutzen wir die erste Spalte nicht mehr. Sie ist bereits in der Form, welche wir uns wünschen.
    Wir betrachten nun die $(n-1)\times (n-1)$-Matrix, welche entsteht durch ignorieren der ersten Spalte und ersten Zeile:|

0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\tr|In this smaller matrix we have to find again a non-zero element in the first column.
    This has to be possible because otherwise the second variable would have appeared only in the first equation of the original linear system.
    But in this case we could simply solve the smaller system, choose the second variable arbitrary and use the original first row to determine the first variable.
    But with a free variable the system would be singular contrary to our assumptions.
   |In dieser Restmatrix müssen wir nun erneut in der ersten Spalte (also in der zweiten Spalte der ursprünglichen Matrix) einen Eintrag ungleich null finden.
   Dies ist möglich, weil sonst die zweite Variable nur in der ersten Gleichung des LGS vorgekommen wäre und somit entweder die erste oder die zweite Variable frei gewählt werden könnte.
   Dann wäre das System aber singulär, aber wir gehen von einem nicht-singulären LGS aus.
   Durch Anwendung von Operation 1 können wir also in der Restmatrix folgende Form erhalten: |
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrr|r}
b\neq 0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\tr|As before we can use operations 2 and 3 to produce zeros below $b$ and using operation 2 we can turn $b$ into a 1.
    Note that these operations do not alter the first row or the first column (why?). Our original matrix now looks like:
   |Nun können wir wieder durch gleiche Argumentation wie oben durch Anwendung von Operation 2 und 3 unterhalb von $b$ alles Nullen erreichen und durch Anwendung von Operation 2 aus $b$ eine 1 machen.
   Beachten Sie, dass diese Operationen die erste Zeile und erste Spalte unserer Orginalmatrix nicht verändern (Wieso?)! Unsere Orginalmatrix sieht nun wie folgt aus: |
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
1& \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&1&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&0&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}

\tr|Again, we can use operations 1-3 to turn all entries on the diagonal into 1's and all entries below the diagonal into 0's.
   |Entsprechend können wir durch Anwendung von Operation 1-3 alle Diagonalelemente zu 1 und alle Einträge unterhalb den Einsen zu Null machen:|
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
1& \cdots&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&1&\cdots&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&0&1&\cdots&\cdots\\
0&0&0&1&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\tr|We have reached triangular form. Again, using operations 2 and 3 we can produce a 0 in the second to last row above the 1. 
   |Die Treppenform ist erreicht. Durch Anwenden von Operation 2 und 3 können wir nun in der zweitletzten Zeile oberhalb der 1 alles Nullen erzeugen. |
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
1& \cdots&\cdots&0&\cdots\\
0&1&\cdots&0&\cdots\\
0&0&1&0&\cdots\\
0&0&0&1&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\tr|And of course we can do the same with all other rows. Finally we have reached reduced triangular form.
   |Und entsprechend auch bei allen anderen 1 oberhalb Nullen erzeugen, so dass wir die reduzierte Treppenform erreichen:|
\begin{eqnarray*}
\left[\begin{array}{rrrr|r}
1&0&0&0&\cdots\\
0&1&0&0&\cdots\\
0&0&1&0&\cdots\\
0&0&0&1&\cdots\\
\end{array}\right]
\end{eqnarray*}
\qed
